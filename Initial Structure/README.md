# Initial Structure
This is a basic structure that a vulkan file should have. Sets up all the basic groundwork to display a simple rotating quad on screen.

Besides the usual necessary vulkan plumbing (setting up physical device, digital device, the swap chain, etc), it includes:
* Use of Vertex Buffers (including a staging buffer for performance)
* Use of Index Buffers
* Use of Uniform Buffers
